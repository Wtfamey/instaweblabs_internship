# Simple Form Project

## What was built
This project contains:
- A simple HTML/CSS page (`form.html`) with a form to collect Name and Email, including JavaScript validation and user feedback via alerts.
- A basic Python script (`form_input.py`) that takes Name and Email as input from the user and prints the received data.

## Tools Used
- **HTML5** and **CSS3** for the web form structure and styling
- **JavaScript** for client-side form validation
- **Python 3** for the command-line script

## How to Run

### 1. HTML Form
- Open the `form.html` file in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Fill in the Name and Email fields and click Submit.
- Alerts will notify you if the form is incomplete or if the email is invalid, or confirm success if all is correct.

### 2. Python Script
- Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
- Open a terminal/command prompt.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- Run the script with:
  ```
  python form_input.py
  ```
- Enter your Name and Email when prompted. The script will print the received data.
